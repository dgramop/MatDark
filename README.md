# MatDark
MatDark is _the_ CSS and JS framework to make websites easier for the user to use and the developer to develop!

It:
- simplifies coding by overriding native methods
- uses easy to guess class names (like "card" instead of stuff like "Mat_Dark-card" and crap like that)
- Is high contrast
	- friendly for people who need high contrast
	- Easy on the eyes
	- Still easy to read

Need to open a modal?

```
alert("This is a modal <b>That also supports HTML</b>");
```
